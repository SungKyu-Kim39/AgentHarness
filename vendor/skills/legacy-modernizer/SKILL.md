This is a reviewed static skill, not an executable plugin. Read only the relevant references. Local guidance needs no external Internet; citation URLs are attribution only. The model connection remains the configured intranet API.

기존 동작의 특성화 테스트·의존성·플랫폼 제약부터 확인한다. 웹 트래픽 전환·마이크로서비스·80% 커버리지·상용 모니터링을 일률적으로 요구하지 않는다. 임베디드/VxWorks→Windows 포팅은 스레드·스케줄링·엔디언·정렬·소켓·시간·파일 경로·ABI와 롤백을 검토한다. 독점 SDK는 자동 반입하지 않는다.

Use approved project reads/searches and host-mediated edits. Do not install packages, download dependencies, fetch remote documentation, deploy, enable hooks, change permissions, spawn agents, or send messages. A command, compiler, browser, database, test runner or SDK mentioned below is not installed by this skill. Use an approved local executor if available; otherwise report verification as not run. Local node_modules examples require an existing package and the appropriate Windows executable path. User decisions and host policy take precedence.

# Legacy Modernizer

## Core Workflow

1. **Assess system** — Analyze codebase, dependencies, risks, and business constraints. Produce a dependency map and risk register before proceeding.
   - *Validation checkpoint:* Confirm all external integrations and data contracts are documented before moving to step 2.

2. **Plan migration** — Design an incremental roadmap with explicit rollback strategies per phase. Reference `references/system-assessment.md` for code analysis templates.
   - *Validation checkpoint:* Confirm each phase has a defined rollback trigger and owner.

3. **Build safety net** — Create characterization tests and monitoring before touching production code. Agree coverage for the actual changed behavior and risk.
   - *Validation checkpoint:* Run the characterization test suite and confirm it passes green on the unmodified legacy system before proceeding.

4. **Migrate incrementally** — Apply strangler fig pattern with feature flags. Route traffic via a facade; shift load gradually.
   - *Validation checkpoint:* Verify error rates and latency metrics remain within baseline thresholds after each traffic increment (e.g., 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%).

5. **Validate & iterate** — Run full test suite, review monitoring dashboards, and confirm business behavior is preserved before retiring legacy code.
   - *Validation checkpoint:* New code must be proven stable at 100% traffic for at least one release cycle before legacy path is removed.

## Reference Guide

Load detailed guidance based on context:

| Topic | Reference | Load When |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Strangler Fig | `references/strangler-fig-pattern.md` | Incremental replacement, facade layer, routing |
| Refactoring | `references/refactoring-patterns.md` | Extract service, branch by abstraction, adapters |
| Migration | `references/migration-strategies.md` | Database, UI, API, framework migrations |
| Testing | `references/legacy-testing.md` | Characterization tests, golden master, approval |
| Assessment | `references/system-assessment.md` | Code analysis, dependency mapping, risk evaluation |

## Code Examples

### Strangler Fig Facade (Python)
```python
# facade.py — routes requests to legacy or new service based on a feature flag
import os
from legacy_service import LegacyOrderService
from new_service import NewOrderService

class OrderServiceFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self._legacy = LegacyOrderService()
        self._new = NewOrderService()

    def get_order(self, order_id: str):
        if os.getenv("USE_NEW_ORDER_SERVICE", "false").lower() == "true":
            return self._new.fetch(order_id)
        return self._legacy.get(order_id)
```

### Feature Flag Wrapper
```python
# feature_flags.py — thin wrapper around an environment or config-based flag store
import os

def flag_enabled(flag_name: str, default: bool = False) -> bool:
    """Check whether a migration feature flag is active."""
    return os.getenv(flag_name, str(default)).lower() == "true"

# Usage
if flag_enabled("USE_NEW_PAYMENT_GATEWAY"):
    result = new_gateway.charge(order)
else:
    result = legacy_gateway.charge(order)
```

### Characterization Test Template (pytest)
```python
# test_characterization_orders.py
# Captures existing legacy behavior as a golden-master safety net.
import pytest
from legacy_service import LegacyOrderService

service = LegacyOrderService()

@pytest.mark.parametrize("order_id,expected_status", [
    ("ORD-001", "SHIPPED"),
    ("ORD-002", "PENDING"),
    ("ORD-003", "CANCELLED"),
])
def test_order_status_golden_master(order_id, expected_status):
    """Fail loudly if legacy behavior changes unexpectedly."""
    result = service.get(order_id)
    assert result["status"] == expected_status, (
        f"Characterization broken for {order_id}: "
        f"expected {expected_status}, got {result['status']}"
    )
```

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Maintain zero production disruption during all migrations
- Create comprehensive test coverage before refactoring (scope matched to actual risk)
- Use feature flags for all incremental rollouts
- Implement monitoring and rollback procedures
- Document all migration decisions and rationale
- Preserve existing business logic and behavior
- Communicate progress and risks transparently

### MUST NOT DO
- Big bang rewrites or replacements
- Skip testing legacy behavior before changes
- Deploy without rollback capability
- Break existing integrations or APIs
- Ignore technical debt in new code
- Rush migrations without proper validation
- Remove legacy code before new code is proven

## Output Templates

When implementing modernization, provide:
1. Assessment summary (risks, dependencies, approach)
2. Migration plan (phases, rollback strategy, metrics)
3. Implementation code (facades, adapters, new services)
4. Test coverage (characterization, integration, e2e)
5. Monitoring setup (metrics, alerts, dashboards)
