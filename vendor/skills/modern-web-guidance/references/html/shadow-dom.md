# Ned local reference

Use only reviewed local Ned host tools. Project reads/searches are automatic; edits, builds, knowledge and desktop actions follow the user-selected host permission mode. Preserve source conflicts, project scope, unsaved editor buffers, frozen execution targets and verified cancellation. Guidance does not grant permissions. Do not install packages, download dependencies, fetch remote documentation, deploy, enable hooks, spawn agents or send messages. Local guidance needs no external Internet. Commands, Python validators, image generation, game engines and browser runners are not installed by a static skill; use an approved local executor if available; otherwise report verification as not run. User decisions and host policy take precedence. Avoid forced Q&A and extra model calls. Read only references relevant to the current task.

# Shadow DOM, Templates & Slots

A shadow root is an encapsulated DOM subtree attached to a host element: styles inside it do not leak out, and page styles do not leak in (except inherited properties). Templates construct the tree efficiently; slots project Light DOM content into it.

## Attaching a shadow root

```javascript
this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open', delegatesFocus: true });
```

`delegatesFocus: true` makes focusing the host move focus to the first focusable element inside the shadow tree, routes `:focus` styling to the host, and on form-associated custom elements (`static formAssociated = true`) forwards `<label>` clicks to the inner control. Set it whenever the component wraps focusable controls. Use `mode: 'open'` in almost all cases so dev tools, page scripts, and server hydration can reach `element.shadowRoot` (see `web-components` (via the corresponding local read_skill reference, if bundled; otherwise report it as unavailable)).

## Templates: construct the tree efficiently

Define a `<template>` **once** (module scope or a static field) and clone it per instance. Cloning a parsed fragment is far faster than re-parsing an `innerHTML` string on every construction.

```javascript
const template = document.createElement('template');
template.innerHTML = `
  <div class="card">
    <slot name="header"></slot>
    <div class="body"><slot></slot></div>
    <slot name="footer"></slot>
  </div>
`;

class MyCard extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    // MANDATORY: deep-clone the template content so each instance gets its own nodes.
    this.shadowRoot.append(template.content.cloneNode(true));
  }
}
customElements.define('my-card', MyCard);
```

Keep templates lean. Deeply nested "div soup" and many levels of nested shadow roots both add measurable style-resolution and layout cost, a major performance hit at scale. Prefer a flat structure and semantic elements.

## Slots: the parts that surprise people

Default vs. named slots work as documented; these are the behaviors that bite:

- **Whitespace counts.** Text nodes between elements (including pure whitespace) are assigned to the default slot, so a default slot is rarely truly "empty."
- **DOM order is preserved, not slot order.** Projected nodes keep their original Light DOM order for `:first-child`/`:last-child` purposes, regardless of which slot they fill. A `::slotted(*:first-child)` rule targets the first *DOM* child, not the first child of that slot, so it often will not match what you expect.
- **`slotchange` is the upgrade-timing signal.** It fires when assigned nodes change (including initial assignment) and is the reliable way to know Light DOM children have arrived after an upgrade, when they may not have existed during `connectedCallback`.

```javascript
this.shadowRoot.querySelector('slot[name="header"]')
  .addEventListener('slotchange', (e) => {
    const nodes = e.target.assignedElements();
    this.toggleAttribute('has-header', nodes.length > 0);
  });
```

## Loading stylesheets into a shadow root

| Method | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `<style>` in the template | Simple, fully encapsulated, works without JS. | Duplicated per instance; bloats the DOM at scale. |
| `<link rel="stylesheet">` | Cacheable external file. | Extra request; risks a flash of unstyled content. |
| `adoptedStyleSheets` | One shared `CSSStyleSheet` across all instances; fastest at scale. | Requires JS; constructed sheets don't support `@import`. |

For many instances of one component, prefer a shared constructed stylesheet:

```javascript
const sheet = new CSSStyleSheet();
sheet.replaceSync(`:host { display: block; }`);

class MyCard extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    // The same sheet object is reused by every instance; no per-instance parse.
    this.shadowRoot.adoptedStyleSheets = [sheet];
  }
}
```
