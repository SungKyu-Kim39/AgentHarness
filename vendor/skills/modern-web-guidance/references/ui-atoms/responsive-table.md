# Ned local reference

Use only reviewed local Ned host tools. Project reads/searches are automatic; edits, builds, knowledge and desktop actions follow the user-selected host permission mode. Preserve source conflicts, project scope, unsaved editor buffers, frozen execution targets and verified cancellation. Guidance does not grant permissions. Do not install packages, download dependencies, fetch remote documentation, deploy, enable hooks, spawn agents or send messages. Local guidance needs no external Internet. Commands, Python validators, image generation, game engines and browser runners are not installed by a static skill; use an approved local executor if available; otherwise report verification as not run. User decisions and host policy take precedence. Avoid forced Q&A and extra model calls. Read only references relevant to the current task.

# Responsive tables

Large data tables often become unreadable on small screens as columns overflow or shrink beyond legibility. This guide demonstrates how to use **sticky positioning** to keep headers visible during scrolling and how to transform the table into a mobile-friendly "stacked" layout when space is limited.

## Recommended Approach

The core of a responsive table is maintaining the relationship between data cells and their headers.

1.  **Semantic Foundation**: Use standard `<table>` elements with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` elements.
2.  **Sticky Context**: Apply `position: sticky` to both column headers and row headers. This ensures that no matter how far a user scrolls in any direction, they never lose the context of what the data represents.
3.  **Adaptive Transformations**: Use `@container` queries instead of `@media` queries. This allows the table to adapt based on its own width (e.g., when placed in a sidebar or a narrow dashboard widget) rather than the entire viewport.
4.  **Label Injection**: In the stacked layout, the `<thead>` is hidden, and accessible headers are injected into each cell using `::before` pseudo-elements and CSS variables.
5.  **Legible Cells**: Keep long cell text on one line instead of letting columns shrink below legibility. See `single-line-overflow` (via the corresponding local read_skill reference, if bundled; otherwise report it as unavailable) for techniques for truncating it and revealing the full text on demand without UX friction.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Markup and Layout

Structure your table with standard semantic headers. Use a `.table-wrapper` to handle overflow and provide a container for queries. Add a `tabindex="0"` attribute to the container, to ensure that people using only a keyboard can consistently scroll the table.

Give the wrapper a `role="region"` attribute to communicate its purpose. Provide it with an accessible name using `aria-labelledby` (referencing the `id` attribute of an existing element that captions/names the table) or an `aria-label` attribute.

```html
<div tabindex="0" role="region" aria-labelledby="employee-table-caption" class="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <caption id="employee-table-caption">Current employee directory</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Employee</th>
        <th>Role</th>
        <th>Status</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <!-- Row header remains sticky horizontally on desktop, 
             and becomes a sticky card header on mobile -->
        <th>Alex Rivera</th>
        <td>Engineer</td>
        <td>Active</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

### 2. Configure Sticky Headers
Enable scrolling and make headers sticky. Use logical properties and explicit z-index values to manage the stacking order.

```css
.table-wrapper {
  overflow: auto;
  max-inline-size: 100%;
  max-block-size: min(500px, 80vh);
  container-type: inline-size;
}

table {
  border-collapse: separate;
  border-spacing: 0;
}

/* Sticky column headers (desktop) */
thead {
  position: sticky;
  inset-block-start: 0;
  z-index: 1; /* Above sticky row headers */
}

/* Sticky row headers (desktop) */
tbody th {
  position: sticky;
  inset-inline-start: 0;
  background: white; /* Required to cover background during scroll */
}
```

### 3. Responsive Stacked Layout
When space is limited, hide the original header row and transform the table into cards. Inject labels using pseudo-elements. Only provide alternative text for non-text content, otherwise this may result in both the text content and accessible name being announced by screen readers.

```css
@container (width < 600px) {
  table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td {
    display: block;
  }

  thead {
    /* MANDATORY: Hide column header from layout and screen readers. */
    display: none
  }

  tr {
    margin-block-end: 1.5rem;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
  }

  /* Sticky row headers at the top of each block/card */
  tbody th {
    position: sticky;
    inset-block-start: 0;
    z-index: 2;
    background: #eee;
  }

  /* Define column labels as CSS variables (often set via JS) */
  table {
    --label-1: "Employee";
    --label-2: "Role";
    --label-3: "Status";
  }

  /* Inject labels */
  td:nth-child(2)::before {
    /* MANDATORY: If using non-text content, provide the accessible name (after the /) which ensures screen readers hear the text alternative. */
    content: var(--label-2) ": ";
  }
  /* MANDATORY: Map the label for each column */
  td:nth-child(3)::before {
    content: var(--label-3) ": ";
  }
}
```
