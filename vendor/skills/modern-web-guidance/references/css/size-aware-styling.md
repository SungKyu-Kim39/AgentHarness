# Ned local reference

Use only reviewed local Ned host tools. Project reads/searches are automatic; edits, builds, knowledge and desktop actions follow the user-selected host permission mode. Preserve source conflicts, project scope, unsaved editor buffers, frozen execution targets and verified cancellation. Guidance does not grant permissions. Do not install packages, download dependencies, fetch remote documentation, deploy, enable hooks, spawn agents or send messages. Local guidance needs no external Internet. Commands, Python validators, image generation, game engines and browser runners are not installed by a static skill; use an approved local executor if available; otherwise report verification as not run. User decisions and host policy take precedence. Avoid forced Q&A and extra model calls. Read only references relevant to the current task.

# Size Aware Styling

## Overview

Size-aware styling allows components to change their layout or appearance based on the space available to them, rather than the size of the whole screen. This is useful for components like cards or navigation bars that might be placed in different parts of a layout (like a narrow sidebar or a wide main area).

Using container queries is recommended because it makes components truly modular. You do not need to know where the component will live or write complex media queries to handle every possible layout.

## Implementation

### 1. Define the container

MANDATORY: You must first tell the browser which element is the container to be measured.

```css
.card-container {
  /* Define the container type. Use 'inline-size' for width-based queries. */
  /* You can also use 'size' for both width and height, but it requires explicit sizing. */
  container-type: inline-size;
}
```

### 2. Apply styles based on container size

Use the `@container` rule to apply styles when the container reaches a certain size.

```css
/* Default styles for small containers (stacked layout) */
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
}

/* Styles for larger containers (side-by-side layout) */
/* This triggers when the container is wider than 400px */
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
  }
  
  .card-image {
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
  }
}
```

### 3. Conditionally show content

You can also use container queries to hide or show extra details when there is more room.

```css
.card-details {
  /* Hide extra details by default in small spaces */
  display: none;
}

@container (min-width: 600px) {
  .card-details {
    /* Show details when there is plenty of room */
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### Fallback strategies

Baseline status for Container queries (size): Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2023-02-14.
Supported by: Chrome 105 (Sep 2022), Edge 105 (Sep 2022), Firefox 110 (Feb 2023), and Safari 16 (Sep 2022).

For browsers that do not support container queries, the best approach is to use a safe default layout (like the stacked vertical layout) and progressively enhance it using media queries if the general screen size allows it.

```css
/* Default safe stacked layout */
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* Fallback using media queries for older browsers */
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}

/* Overwrite with container queries where supported */
@supports (container-type: inline-size) {
  @media (min-width: 600px) {
    .card {
      /* Reset media query fallback if needed, or let container query handle it */
      flex-direction: column;
    }
  }
  
  @container (min-width: 400px) {
    .card {
      flex-direction: row;
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that users on older browsers still get a usable layout, even if it does not adapt perfectly to every specific container width.
