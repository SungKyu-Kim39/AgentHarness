# Ned local reference

Use only reviewed local Ned host tools. Project reads/searches are automatic; edits, builds, knowledge and desktop actions follow the user-selected host permission mode. Preserve source conflicts, project scope, unsaved editor buffers, frozen execution targets and verified cancellation. Guidance does not grant permissions. Do not install packages, download dependencies, fetch remote documentation, deploy, enable hooks, spawn agents or send messages. Local guidance needs no external Internet. Commands, Python validators, image generation, game engines and browser runners are not installed by a static skill; use an approved local executor if available; otherwise report verification as not run. User decisions and host policy take precedence. Avoid forced Q&A and extra model calls. Read only references relevant to the current task.

# Persistent Top Layer UI

When moving an open `<dialog>`, `popover`, or fullscreen element in the DOM using traditional methods like `appendChild()` or `insertBefore()`, the browser implicitly removes the element from the DOM and re-inserts it. This removal resets the state, causing open modals, popovers, and fullscreen elements to close abruptly.

To reparent top-layer elements without interrupting the user experience or closing them, use the atomic `moveBefore()` API instead.

### Reparenting open top-layer elements

`moveBefore()` takes two arguments: the node to move, and a reference node to insert before (or `null` to append to the end of the new parent).

```javascript
const newParent = document.getElementById('new-container');
const dialogElement = document.getElementById('my-dialog');

// MANDATORY: Use moveBefore to ensure the <dialog> or popover stays open.
// Passing null appends it to the end of newParent.
newParent.moveBefore(dialogElement, null);
```

### Fallback strategies

Browser support for moveBefore(): Limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 133 (Feb 2025), Edge 133 (Feb 2025), and Firefox 144 (Oct 2025).
Unsupported in: Safari.

Since `moveBefore()` is a progressive enhancement, you MUST use feature detection before calling it. For older browsers, you will have to fallback to traditional reparenting.

**MANDATORY**: For `<dialog>` elements in unsupported browsers, the traditional move will close the dialog. If you need it to remain open, you must manually re-open it after the move.

```javascript
const targetParent = document.getElementById('target-container');
const popoverOrDialog = document.getElementById('my-top-layer-element');

// Check if moveBefore is supported
if ('moveBefore' in Element.prototype) {
  targetParent.moveBefore(popoverOrDialog, null);
} else {
  // Fallback: traditional move.
  // Note: This WILL close <dialog>, popover, and fullscreen elements.
  const wasOpen = popoverOrDialog.hasAttribute('open') || popoverOrDialog.matches(':popover-open');
  targetParent.insertBefore(popoverOrDialog, null);
  
  // Manually restore state if possible
  if (wasOpen && typeof popoverOrDialog.showModal === 'function') {
    popoverOrDialog.showModal();
  } else if (wasOpen && typeof popoverOrDialog.showPopover === 'function') {
    popoverOrDialog.showPopover();
  }
}
```
