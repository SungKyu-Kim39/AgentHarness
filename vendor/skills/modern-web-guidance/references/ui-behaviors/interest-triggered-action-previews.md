# Ned local reference

Use only reviewed local Ned host tools. Project reads/searches are automatic; edits, builds, knowledge and desktop actions follow the user-selected host permission mode. Preserve source conflicts, project scope, unsaved editor buffers, frozen execution targets and verified cancellation. Guidance does not grant permissions. Do not install packages, download dependencies, fetch remote documentation, deploy, enable hooks, spawn agents or send messages. Local guidance needs no external Internet. Commands, Python validators, image generation, game engines and browser runners are not installed by a static skill; use an approved local executor if available; otherwise report verification as not run. User decisions and host policy take precedence. Avoid forced Q&A and extra model calls. Read only references relevant to the current task.

# Interest Triggered Action Previews

It can be beneficial to provide users a preview of their actions before they commit to them. Interest invokers are an experimental web platform feature that provides a declarative-based way of creating interest relationships between an interest source (i.e. a button or a link) and an interest target. Once the declarative relationship has been established there are a number of methods a developer can respond to based on interest and loss of interest using both CSS and JavaScript. For this use case, we can leverage the `interest` and `loseinterest` events to preview various effects for an interest target.

## How to implement

An interest relationship is created by setting the `interestfor` attribute on a button or link (i.e. the interest source). The attribute takes an ID reference to another element (i.e. the interest target). Interest invokers or sources can only have a single interest target, but an interest target can have multiple interest invokers.

```html
<!-- MANDATORY: interest relationships must be established with the `interestfor` attribute on a button or a link -->
<button interestfor="interestingElement" data-effect="A">Some effect</button>
<button interestfor="interestingElement" data-effect="B">Some other effect</button>
<div id="interestingElement">Something interesting</div>
```

For the sake of this use case, we can leverage the `interest` and `loseinterest` events to preview various effects for an interest target. Both of these events are `InterestEvent`s which has a `source` property which is the source of the interest (i.e. the element with the `interestfor` attribute).

```javascript
interestingElement.addEventListener("interest", event => {
  // Apply the preview based on `event.source`
  event.target.dataset.preview = event.source.dataset.effect;
});

interestingElement.addEventListener("loseinterest", event => {
  // Unapply the preview
  delete event.target.dataset.preview;
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Don't announce interest-driven previews via a live region.** Interest can be triggered just by moving the pointer across the page or tabbing through nearby buttons, so apply/unapply announcements quickly become noise that can drown out content the user actually cares about. The preview itself is the affordance; users who can perceive it benefit directly, and those who can't will not benefit from a verbal echo of "Previewing effect: A". If you decide you genuinely need an announcement for a specific case, make sure to test it carefully with users.

Active interest sources and targets can be selected with CSS using the `:interest-source` and `:interest-target` pseudo-selectors respectively.

```css
/* Styles to apply when the effect is being previewed */
:interest-source {}
:interest-target {}
```

The start and end delay for an interest invoker (i.e. the element with the `interestfor` attribute) can be set with the `interest-delay-start` and `interest-delay-end` CSS properties or the shorthand `interest-delay` property.

```css
[interestfor] {
  interest-delay-start: 0.2s;
  interest-delay-end: 0.1s;
}
```

### Fallback strategies

### Fallbacks & browser support for Interest invokers

Browser support for Interest invokers: Limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 149 (Jun 2026) and Edge 149 (Jun 2026).
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

Interest invokers must be conditionally polyfilled using the `interestfor` polyfill package from NPM. Prefer bundling the polyfill over using the CDN.

**MANDATORY:** Feature detect by checking for the `interestForElement` property on `HTMLButtonElement.prototype`, and load the polyfill **only** when native support is missing.

```html
<script type="module">
  if (!("interestForElement" in HTMLButtonElement.prototype)) {
    // CDN link only used for example, prefer bundling.
    await import("https://unpkg.com/interestfor@latest");
  }
</script>
```

### CSS Polyfill Caveats

When using the polyfill, the CSS API changes slightly to account for the lack of native pseudo-class and property support:

- **Pseudo-classes:** The polyfill cannot define real `:interest-source` and `:interest-target` pseudo-classes, so it applies `.interest-source` and `.interest-target` classes instead. **MANDATORY:** Combine them with `:is()` to support both native and polyfilled states.

```css
/* Styles to apply when the effect is being previewed */
:is(:interest-source, .interest-source) { /* ... */ }
:is(:interest-target, .interest-target) { /* ... */ }
```

- **CSS Properties:** For `interest-delay`, `interest-delay-start`, and `interest-delay-end`, the polyfill requires using CSS variables as it cannot read the custom properties directly in all browsers.

```css
/* Adjust the start and end delay for interest invokers */
[interestfor] {
  --interest-delay-start: 0.2s;
  interest-delay-start: var(--interest-delay-start);
  --interest-delay-end: 0.1s;
  interest-delay-end: var(--interest-delay-end);
}
```
