# Ned local reference

Use only reviewed local Ned host tools. Project reads/searches are automatic; edits, builds, knowledge and desktop actions follow the user-selected host permission mode. Preserve source conflicts, project scope, unsaved editor buffers, frozen execution targets and verified cancellation. Guidance does not grant permissions. Do not install packages, download dependencies, fetch remote documentation, deploy, enable hooks, spawn agents or send messages. Local guidance needs no external Internet. Commands, Python validators, image generation, game engines and browser runners are not installed by a static skill; use an approved local executor if available; otherwise report verification as not run. User decisions and host policy take precedence. Avoid forced Q&A and extra model calls. Read only references relevant to the current task.

# Passkey Reauthentication

This delta-focused guide details how to implement step-up authentication or re-verification for a signed-in user before they perform sensitive account changes (e.g. passwords updates, financial transfers).

## Delta Flow Architecture

Unlike regular authentication, passkey reauthentication constrains passkey dialog prompts strictly to the logged-in user's pre-registered credentials to prevent account-mixing or passkey spoofing during active sessions.

## Server-Side

### Options Generation Delta

Create an endpoint that populates the allowed credentials parameters specifically for the active, known user:

**Constrain Credentials**: Populate the `allowCredentials` options array with specific `PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor` records mapping all registered credential IDs for the signed-in user. Leaving this empty or omitting it regresses to discoverable credentials, violating session safety.

```javascript
// Node.js step-up options generation example
router.post("/api/reauth/options", enforceActiveSession, async (req, res) => {
  const userPasskeys = await db.findCredentialsByUserId(req.user.id);

  const options = {
    challenge: serverGeneratedBase64UrlChallenge, // Random challenge stored in user session
    rpId: "example.com",
    // Enforce allowance strictly limited to the user's credentials list
    allowCredentials: userPasskeys.map((cred) => ({
      type: "public-key",
      id: cred.id,
      transports: cred.transports, // Speeds up resolution by indicating platform transports
    })),
  };
  return res.json(options);
});
```

### Verification Endpoint Delta

Verify the assertion returned by the client:

**Verify Account Ownership**: The verification endpoint MUST explicitly verify that the resulting authenticated credential ID returned by the client resolves to a stored credential record whose associated user ID strictly matches the active signed-in user (`storedCredential.passkeyUserId === req.user.id`). If a valid passkey of a _different_ user is returned, authentication MUST be rejected immediately.

## Client-Side Flow Deltas

Applications choose from two reauthentication interfaces depending on the transaction UI:

### A. Button Flow (No Input Fields)

Trigger reauthentication when a user presses a "Verify Identity" or "Proceed with Transaction" button. When signaling an unknown credential on HTTP `404`, always pass `rpId: publicKey.rpId` from the server's request options—**DO NOT** derive `rpId` from `window.location.hostname` on the client.

```html
<button id="reauth-btn" data-testid="reauth-button">Confirm Transaction</button>
```

```javascript
let reauthAbortController = new AbortController();

async function triggerButtonReauth() {
  // Abort any background suggestion flows to avoid passkey prompt collisions
  reauthAbortController.abort();
  reauthAbortController = new AbortController();

  const optionsResponse = await fetch("/api/reauth/options", {
    method: "POST",
  });
  const optionsJSON = await optionsResponse.json();
  const publicKey =
    PublicKeyCredential.parseRequestOptionsFromJSON(optionsJSON);

  try {
    const credential = await navigator.credentials.get({
      publicKey,
      signal: reauthAbortController.signal,
    });

    if (credential) {
      const encodedCredential = credential.toJSON();
      const verifyResponse = await fetch("/api/reauth/verify", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(encodedCredential),
      });

      if (verifyResponse.ok) {
        showTransactionSuccessUI();
      } else if (verifyResponse.status === 404 && PublicKeyCredential.signalUnknownCredential) {
        await PublicKeyCredential.signalUnknownCredential({
          rpId: publicKey.rpId, // Always use the server-provided rpId; DO NOT use window.location.hostname
          credentialId: encodedCredential.id
        });
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.name === "NotAllowedError") {
      console.log("User cancelled reauthentication.");
    }
  }
}

document
  .getElementById("reauth-btn")
  .addEventListener("click", triggerButtonReauth);
```

## Fallback Strategies

### Passkey feature detection fallback

Baseline status for the api.PublicKeyCredential.getClientCapabilities_static capability: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-02-06.
Supported by: Chrome 133 (Feb 2025), Edge 133 (Feb 2025), Firefox 135 (Feb 2025), and Safari 17.4 (Mar 2024).

Load `webauthn-polyfills` so `PublicKeyCredential.getClientCapabilities()` is available whenever `PublicKeyCredential` is supported:

```js
// With a bundler (`use an already imported reviewed local dependency; no installation or download`):
import 'webauthn-polyfills';
```

Without a bundler, serve the package from your own origin, or import it from a CDN such as `https://esm.sh/webauthn-polyfills@0.1.7` (pin the exact version). For third-party URLs, add Subresource Integrity: the `integrity` attribute on the `<script>` tag, or an import map's `integrity` field for `import` statements.

### Signal API Synchronization Fallback

Browser support for Web authentication signal methods: Limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 132 (Jan 2025), Edge 132 (Jan 2025), and Safari 26 (Sep 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox.

The WebAuthn Signal API (`webauthn-signals`) is a progressive optimization used to keep password managers in sync with the server credential state.

- **Fallback Experience**: Gate calls behind `if (PublicKeyCredential.signalUnknownCredential)`. If unsupported, the background verification sync is bypassed gracefully without throwing browser exceptions.

### Easy JSON Serialization Fallback

Baseline status for the api.PublicKeyCredential.parseRequestOptionsFromJSON_static capability: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-03-31.
Supported by: Chrome 129 (Sep 2024), Edge 129 (Sep 2024), Firefox 119 (Oct 2023), and Safari 18.4 (Mar 2025).

Load `webauthn-polyfills` so `PublicKeyCredential.parseRequestOptionsFromJSON()` and `PublicKeyCredential.prototype.toJSON()` are available whenever `PublicKeyCredential` is supported:

```js
// With a bundler (`use an already imported reviewed local dependency; no installation or download`):
import 'webauthn-polyfills';
```

Without a bundler, serve the package from your own origin, or import it from a CDN such as `https://esm.sh/webauthn-polyfills@0.1.7` (pin the exact version). For third-party URLs, add Subresource Integrity: the `integrity` attribute on the `<script>` tag, or an import map's `integrity` field for `import` statements.
