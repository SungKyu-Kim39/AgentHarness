# Ned offline adaptation

This is a reviewed static skill, not an executable plugin. Read only the relevant references. Local guidance needs no external Internet; citation URLs are attribution only. The model connection remains the configured intranet API.

실제 범위·호환성·데이터 보존에 영향을 주는 결정만 짧게 기록한다. 기존 Conductor spec/plan·ADR을 재사용한다. 팀 리뷰·알림·티켓 생성은 사용자가 요구하거나 기존 팀 정책이 있을 때만 다루며 메시지를 자동 전송하지 않는다. ADR 파일 생성·상태 변경은 승인된 프로젝트 편집이다.

Use approved project reads/searches and host-mediated edits. Do not install packages, download dependencies, fetch remote documentation, deploy, enable hooks, change permissions, spawn agents, or send messages. A command, compiler, browser, database, test runner or SDK mentioned below is not installed by this skill. Use an approved local executor if available; otherwise report verification as not run. Local node_modules examples require an existing package and the appropriate Windows executable path. User decisions and host policy take precedence. See ADAPTATION.md for provenance and modifications.

# Architecture Decision Records

Comprehensive patterns for creating, maintaining, and managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that capture the context and rationale behind significant technical decisions.

## When to Use This Skill

- Making significant architectural decisions
- Documenting technology choices
- Recording design trade-offs
- Onboarding new team members
- Reviewing historical decisions
- Establishing decision-making processes

## Core Concepts

### 1. What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures:

- **Context**: Why we needed to make a decision
- **Decision**: What we decided
- **Consequences**: What happens as a result

### 2. When to Write an ADR

| Write ADR                  | Skip ADR               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| New framework adoption     | Minor version upgrades |
| Database technology choice | Bug fixes              |
| API design patterns        | Implementation details |
| Security architecture      | Routine maintenance    |
| Integration patterns       | Configuration changes  |

### 3. ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated → Superseded
              ↓
           Rejected
```

Before drafting a standard, lightweight, or Y-statement ADR, read [decision templates](references/decision-templates.md).

Before drafting a deprecation ADR or RFC, read [deprecation and RFC templates](references/deprecation-rfc-templates.md).

## ADR Management

### Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── adr/
│   ├── README.md           # Index and guidelines
│   ├── template.md         # Team's ADR template
│   ├── 0001-use-postgresql.md
│   ├── 0002-caching-strategy.md
│   ├── 0003-mongodb-user-profiles.md  # [DEPRECATED]
│   └── 0020-deprecate-mongodb.md      # Supersedes 0003
```

### ADR Index (README.md)

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for [Project Name].

## Index

| ADR                                   | Title                              | Status     | Date       |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| [0001](0001-use-postgresql.md)        | Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database | Accepted   | 2024-01-10 |
| [0002](0002-caching-strategy.md)      | Caching Strategy with Redis        | Accepted   | 2024-01-12 |
| [0003](0003-mongodb-user-profiles.md) | MongoDB for User Profiles          | Deprecated | 2023-06-15 |
| [0020](0020-deprecate-mongodb.md)     | Deprecate MongoDB                  | Accepted   | 2024-01-15 |

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`
2. Fill in the template
3. Submit PR for review
4. Update this index after approval

## ADR Status

- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision made, implementing
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR
- **Rejected**: Considered but not adopted
```

### Local document workflow

Use the bundled decision templates and approved host edits to propose an ADR and its index entry. No adr-tools installation is needed. Supersede accepted decisions with a new record instead of overwriting their rationale.

## Review Process

```markdown
## ADR Review Checklist

### Before Submission

- [ ] Context clearly explains the problem
- [ ] All viable options considered
- [ ] Pros/cons balanced and honest
- [ ] Consequences (positive and negative) documented
- [ ] Related ADRs linked

### During Review

- [ ] Reviewers required by the existing team policy consulted
- [ ] Affected teams consulted
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Cost implications documented
- [ ] Reversibility assessed

### After Acceptance

- [ ] ADR index updated
- [ ] Team notification handled only if explicitly requested
- [ ] Implementation tickets created
- [ ] Related documentation updated
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Write ADRs early** - Before implementation starts
- **Keep them short** - 1-2 pages maximum
- **Be honest about trade-offs** - Include real cons
- **Link related decisions** - Build decision graph
- **Update status** - Deprecate when superseded

### Don'ts

- **Don't change accepted ADRs** - Write new ones to supersede
- **Don't skip context** - Future readers need background
- **Don't hide failures** - Rejected decisions are valuable
- **Don't be vague** - Specific decisions, specific consequences
- **Don't forget implementation** - ADR without action is waste
